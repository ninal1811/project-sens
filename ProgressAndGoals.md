# Progress

## API Server

The following lists what was completed during the Fall 2025 semester.

- Created an API server for geographical data.
- Implemented CRUD operations for related datasets, which includes countries, states, and cities.
- Implemented more than 12 API endpoints (get exact count and endpoint names).
- Each endpoint includes corresponding unit tests.
- All endpoints are documented using Swagger.
- Relevant data is cached to improve performance.
- The project was deployed to PythonAnywhere.

This fulfills the following requirements established.

- Create an API server for a geographic database.
- Implement CRUD operations on related datasets.
- Include a dozen or more endpoints.
- Ensure all endpoints have unit tests.
- Deploy the project to the cloud using CI/CD.


# Goals

These are the goals we want to accomplish in the Spring 2026 semester.

- Create a robust frontend on React that displays popular food around the world by geographic region.
- Load more countries, states, and cities data to MongoDB
- Load data related to popular food by region.
- Work on the backend API Server to process data related to food (add queries, tests, etc).
- Handle security.

## Create a robust frontend on React that displays popular food around the world by region

- Build a React frontend application.
- Display regions and associated popular foods.
- Connect the frontend to the backend API.
- Ensure each API endpoint has a corresponding frontend view.
- We will use React + Vite to build the frontend and use React Testing Library + Vitest for testing purposes.

Purpose: Allows backend data to be better visualized.

## Load more countries, states, and cities data to MongoDB

- Find additional geographic data from Kaggle.
- Create ETL scripts to load geographic data into MongoDB.
- Note: For countries that have provinces, we will count the provinces as states.
- Note: Our Geographic regions will be:
